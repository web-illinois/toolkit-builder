                What happens if I retake a course?
                </summary>
                <p>By default, if you retake a course, both grades are listed on your transcript and both are counted in your GPA. You only receive credit hours for one instance of the course, though. If you want to retake a course and received a C- or below during your first attempt, you may be eligible for <a href="https://appserv7.admin.uillinois.edu/FormBuilderSurvey/Survey/uiuc_aces/oap/grade_replacment/">grade replacement</a>. Both instances of the course must be taken here at the University of Illinois. You can find the form for Grade Replacement on the <a href="https://aces.illinois.edu/academics/current-students/forms">ACES Academic Programs Forms &amp; Petitions Page.</a> There are deadlines for declaring Grade Replacement, so it is important you check the <a href="https://registrar.illinois.edu/academic-calendars/">Office of the Registrar’s website</a> for updated academic deadlines.</p>
                <p>Remember, both instances of the course must be taken here at the University of Illinois to be eligible for Grade Replacement. If you retake a course at a community college or other university, then you cannot use Grade Replacement.</p>
