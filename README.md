# Web toolkit builder

The goal of this is to help test the web components and to serve as a training module for new users.

You can run the following commands to build the test site:

````
npm install
npm rebuild
npm run build-html
````

This will generate a static site under _site. You can use a live server tool to run this from your local machine.
