# Components

The toolkit is a way to easily build components that have been designed by the WIGG Design group. It may not meet all of your needs, so don't feel like you are constrained to use just these options or force you content to these components. Using these components is not a matter of being compliant with the web theme, it's being compliant with the brand standards. As we update the web components, you can easily get the benefits of these updates without having to hand-code a lot of changes yourself. 

Do you have questions about how to use the Illinois Toolkit Web Components? Here are some tools to help you build them and experiment with how they look.
