# Color Checker

This is a simple color checker used to test Illinois colors with AA accessibility, using the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Note that while these colors meet accessibility requirements, you should have actual people test the final color combination.

For gradients, you should test all colors used in the gradient and only use the colors that are accessible on all options.
