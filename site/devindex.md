## Alternate Versions of the Web Components

The component builder can now be used to test alternate versions of the web toolkit components. This is split out into two groups:

* *Legacy:* Older versions of the toolkit, for users who want to experiment with sites that are using older versions. 
* *Development:* Newer versions of the toolkit, for users that are planning to use the latest. 

Both the legacy and development versions may be mixed and matched with other CSS and JS to verify that the two sets of styles and scripts will play well with each other and not produce unexpected results. The CSS and JS need to be public. If you need a custom-built enviroment, please [create an issue](https://github.com/web-illinois/toolkit-builder/issues/new) including the full paths of any other CSS/JS and it can be built.
